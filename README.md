# JioSaavn Sign Up Form
This sign-up form is inspired by JioSaavn, a popular music streaming platform in India. It incorporates features like input validation and password visibility, similar to Spotify.

# What it Does:

Users can enter their email address, create a username, and choose a password.
The form provides a visual confirmation of completed fields by changing the input outline color (green for filled, red for empty).
To reveal the password for verification, users can click the "eye" icon next to the password field. This icon changes color to green when activated.
If the form is submitted with any empty fields, a message appears prompting the user to complete all sections.

# What I Learned:

- DOM Manipulation: I honed my skills in selecting HTML elements within the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript.
- JavaScript Loops: I leveraged JavaScript loops for efficient manipulation of multiple input fields and their corresponding visual feedback.
- Function Development: Building well-structured functions improved code organization and reusability.
